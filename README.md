## About the site

After watching a React tutorial from Brian Design on youtube, I made this website to practice what I learned about React. It was fun designing the website from scratch in Figma and coding it out step by step with styled-components. I also added some pages to continue learning about React router and how it is used. Overall I learned a lot and googled alot too, haha.
